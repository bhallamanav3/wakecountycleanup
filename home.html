                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>As rapid consumerism and urbanization flourishes in this day and age, trash pollution has become a preeminent issue for the world. In 1990, the amount of trash pollution in landfills in the United States totaled to 208.3 million tons. In 2018, this figure rose to almost 300 million tons and this figure is only on the uphill. According to a 2017 statistic, 12 million tons of trash pollution is produced every year in North Carolina and according to another study, 11.5 million pounds of roadside garbage was collected in 2022, costing taxpayers 22 million dollars to clean up. </p>
                <p>Wake County Cleanup Project (WCCP) is a sustainability initiative that is focused on educating young teens about trash pollution and how they can do their part in solving the trash crisis. We plan to educate our peers about sustainability and teach them how they can combat the detrimental effects of trash pollution through service events and presentations.

                <h2> Project Goals</h2>
                <h3>Advocate</h3>
                <p>Our first goal for our project is to make our community aware of the problems that arise from pollution. We touched on ways to recycle and ways to reduce pollution and littering. We gave them strategies that we use and use ourselves as examples so they know that other students are participating. We are hoping this makes it relatable and encourages students to participate. </p>
                <h3>Action</h3>
                <p> The second key tenet our project is cleaning up our school and the surrounding community in order to ensure the sanctity of our local ecosystem. We plan on working with our townâ€™s Chamber of Commerce and our high school to schedule two separate clean up events where students and people from the community can come out and clean the town. Through these events,  our volunteers will learn the importance of sustainability and their role in preventing trash pollution. 
                </p>
                <h3>Advance</h3>
                <p>The third and final key tenet of the project is to make sure that our project lasts for as long as possible. As a group, we have been a part of a plethora of different clean up events in the past and as we embark on this project we hope to make sure that the overall initiative and goal lasts well after this school year is over. In order to accomplish this, we plan on creating a website that details exactly how we created our clean up events so that anyone from anywhere in the world can utilize the formula we used to create their own events and help combat the trash pollution crisis.
