                    <h3>Find a Location</h3>
                    <p>The first step in creating a clean up event is finding the proper location to hold the event. This can be in areas such as parking lots, school campuses, and side streets. In order to properly ascertain the optimal location, it could be beneficial to ask members of your community where they believe the most affected areas are. </p>

                    <h3>Obtain Materials</h3>
                    <p>The third step to a great clean up event is finding materials for your volunteers such as trash bags, safety vests, and trash grabbers. These materials can be obtained from your town, county, or other clean up organizations in and around your area.</p>

                <h4>Way 1</h4>
                <p>Avoid single use or disposable items. Buying things such as plastic water bottles or plastic bags greatly increases the potential for trash to end up in the oceans and in the street.
                </p>
                <h4>Way 2</h4>
                <p>Donate. Giving away items you donâ€™t need to efforts like the Salvation Army or GoodWill can greatly reduce the amount of trash pollution while also giving back to those in need.</p>
                <h4>Way 3</h4>
                <p>Purchase goods from local stores or companies that support clean up efforts. Buying local reduces the amount of packaging that comes from shipping while boosting your local economy and buying from companies that support clean up efforts ensures that your money is being used to better the environment. </p>
