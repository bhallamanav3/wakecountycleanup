                <h3>Manav Bhalla</h3>
                <p>Hey everyone! I'm Manav Bhalla. I am a resident in the Raleigh/Wake Forest area and I currently attend the local high school, Wake Forest High
                  School, where I am a senior. I am involved with a variety of different clubs at my school and constantly
                  work to make a difference in my community. 
                  
                  For the past 2 years, I have been involved with a local clean up effort called Cleanup 919 picking up 
                  almost 600 pounds of trash in and around the Raleigh area. 
                  
                  I am dedicated to protecting my environment and the ecosystem around me and hope to spread the
                  knowledge about trash pollution. 
                  </p>
